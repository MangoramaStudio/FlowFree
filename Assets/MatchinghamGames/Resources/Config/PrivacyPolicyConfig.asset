    the Game may be controlled by the relevant Store\u2019s terms and conditions
    and policies as made available to you by the Store. To the extent that there
    is a conflict between the terms of these T&Cs and the relevant Store\u2019s terms
    from which you purchased (where applicable) or installed the Game, the Store\u2019s
    terms shall prevail to the extent of the conflict.\n11.2 The Game may provide
    for certain additional content and features available through in-app purchase(s)
    (\u201CVirtual Items\u201D). The terms of this T&C and specifically this clause
    12 shall govern all such Virtual Items.\n11.3 This clause applies insofar as
    the Game permits you to earn, obtain or use Virtual Items. You may use Virtual
    Items in connection with permitted use of the Game and, where applicable, in
    any third party applications in which such Virtual Items may also be used. You
    do not own the Virtual Items. You only have a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    revocable licence to use them, for their permitted uses, as may be amended and
    notified to you from time to time, in connection with the Game and subject to
    your compliance with the terms of this T&C. Where you purchase Virtual Items
    from us, the purchase will be subject to our then applicable terms of sale, including
    any additional fees that are applicable for Virtual Items that can be used in
    third party applications. These will be made available to you at the time of
    each purchase.\n11.4 We or third parties may offer access to paid-for Content
    on, or in connection with, the Game (including access to paid virtual events).
    Such access will be subject to the then applicable terms of sale and use. These
    will be made available to you at the time of each purchase.\n11.5 You understand
    and agree that Virtual Items have no cash or redemption value and your licence
    to use them will be suspended and/or terminated if you are denied access to your
    account or your account is shut down, frozen or terminated for any reason in
    accordance with this T&C. We shall have no obligation to make any refund or otherwise
    compensate you in any amount, unless expressly indicated otherwise and subject
    to your mandatory consumer rights.\n11.6 You are not permitted to trade, exchange,
    sell, rent or otherwise transfer or deal in the Virtual Items or your account,
    without our prior written permission. You shall not access or use any account
    or Virtual Items which have been traded, exchanged, sold, rented or otherwise
    transferred or dealt in.\n11.7 If the Game offers a subscription-based premium
    feature package, it enables users to use the app without advertisements and with
    extra features. It will include an auto-renewable subscription, with a weekly
    subscription period. In this case, payment will be charged to your Store account
    upon confirmation of the subscription and the subscription period will be weekly.
    In this case subscription will be renewed unless turned off 24 hours before the
    end of the period, and the account will be automatically charged for renewal
    as well. If you subscribe, your account will be charged for renewal within 24
    hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your
    subscriptions by going to your account settings in the Store. If a free trial
    period is offered and if you purchase a subscription, any unused portion of the
    free trial period will be forfeited.\nOPERATING SYSTEM AND DEVICE REQUIREMNENTS\n12.1
    The Game is provided by us in English and the other languages described on the
    Stores.\n12.2 An internet connection is required to use certain aspects of the
    Game. Other operating and system requirements apply (such as in respect of operating
    system and installation memory \u2013 depending upon the relevant Game); information
    about these requirements will be made available to you, either by Store descriptions,
    packaging information or through our website.\nTERMINATION AND SERVICE OUTAGE\n13.1
    We may temporarily discontinue the Game and any and all services and content
    available through them at any time for the purposes of upgrades, maintenance
    or other service administration reasons. We will use our reasonable endeavours
    to limit the length of time this occurs for.\n13.2 We may end your rights to
    use the Game at any time in the event that you breach these T&Cs. If what you
    have done can be put right, we may, in our sole discretion, give you a reasonable
    opportunity to do so. Where you have paid for the Game, content or services in
    connection with the Game and your rights have been terminated in accordance with
    this clause because of your breach of these T&Cs, we will not refund you.\n13.3
    We may terminate our agreement with you (in whole or in part) for any reason
    at our discretion upon reasonable notice to you. This may happen, without limitation,
    because we choose to end the availability of the Game. If your use of the Game
    was provided to you free of charge, you will not be entitled to compensation
    in this event. If you paid for the Game, content or services in connection with
    the Game, you will not be entitled to a refund where you have substantially had
    the enjoyment of what you had paid for. Where you have not had a reasonable period
    of opportunity to enjoy the paid-for Game, we may offer you a partial or full
    refund.\n13.4 Upon your deletion/uninstallation of the Game, any in-Game rankings
    or scores, including virtual currency balances (whether earned or purchased),
    or scores or information in connection with the Game services will not be retained
    or accessible. These may not be recoverable by us once they are deleted or made
    inaccessible.\nGENERAL\n14.1 These T&Cs do not affect any legal rights you may
    have under the law which cannot be excluded or limited.\n14.2 We may change or
    update these T&Cs from time to time, but changes only affect you to the extent
    they can legally apply. For example, if we release an update with a new set of
    T&Cs, and you don\u2019t use the update, then the old set of T&Cs applies, but
    if you do use the updates or if you use parts of the Game(s) that rely on our
    ongoing online services then the new T&Cs will apply. Please check back at our
    website from time to time in case of updates to the T&Cs.\n14.3 We may transfer
    our rights and obligations under these T&Cs to another organisation. We will
    let you know if that happens and we will ensure that your rights under these
    T&Cs are unaffected. You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these
    T&Cs unless we expressly agree to the transfer in writing.\n14.4 Even if we delay
    in enforcing these T&Cs and/or our rights, we can still enforce these T&Cs and/or
    our rights later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
    required to do under these T&Cs, or if we delay in taking steps against you in
    respect of your breaking of any term of these T&Cs, that will not mean that you
    do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against
    you at a later date.\n14.5 If a dispute arises between you and us, we strongly
    encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution thorugh the communication
    channels under Contact Us section. These T&Cs are governed by Turkish law and
    you can bring proceedings in respect of the Game or these T&Cs in courts of Republic
    of Turkey.\nCOMPLAINTS AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n15.1 Should you have
    any queries or complaints, please get in touch via the contact information set
    out in clause 17 below.\n15.2 Alternative dispute resolution is a process where
    an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it,
    without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled
    any complaint, you may want to consider an alternative dispute resolution provider.\nCOMPANY
